The numerical resolution of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations has been implemented and validated in three stages.

In the first part, a known analytical solution was used to validate the implementation of convective and diffusive terms. By computing numerical errors over a range of grid sizes, the error plot confirmed a second-order convergence rate. This validates the finite-difference discretization schemes used for both convective and diffusive terms.

The second part focused on enforcing incompressibility using a projection method. Starting from a velocity field with artificial divergence. The pseudo-pressure gradients aligned correctly with the divergence sources, and the visualizations confirmed that the velocity field became divergence-free after correction.

The final part combined the previous components into a full time-dependent simulation . The temporal evolution was validated against the analytical solution, showing a close match to the analytical one in both velocity and pressure over time, and the convergence study confirmed second-order spatial accuracy. Divergence remained low throughout the simulation, confirming the effectiveness of the projection step. Additionally, particle trajectory animations showed smooth motion consistent with the velocity field.

Overall, the solver performs accurately and reliably across all tested aspects:
It achieves second-order convergence in space, it correctly enforces the divergence-free condition through a pressure correction step and it reproduces time-dependent flow behavior with accurately compared to analytical references.
